				Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. 			</p>

			<p>
				The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href='#Reference-Python-site'>https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.

			<p>Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C). click here for <a href='#Reference-Python-Hello'>reference</a>

			<code>
				print('Hello World')

				Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
			</p>
			<p>
				Python supports two types of numbers - integers and floating point numbers.
<br>define an integer, use the following syntax:
			</p>
			<code>
				myint = 7<br>
				print(myint)
			</code>
			<p>
				To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations:
			</p>
			<code>
				myfloat = 7.0<br>
				print(myfloat)
			</code>
			<p>
				Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.
			</p>
			<code>
				mystring = 'hello'
				print(mystring)
			</code>

		<header>Data Types</header>
		<article>
			<p>
				There are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects. Additional sequence types tailored for processing of binary data and text strings are described in dedicated sections.
			</p>
			<p><h3>Lists</h3>
				Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.
			</p>
			<code>
				mylist = []<br>
				mylist.append(1)<br>
				mylist.append(2)<br>
				mylist.append(3)<br>
				print(mylist[0]) # prints 1<br>
				print(mylist[1]) # prints 2<br>
				print(mylist[2]) # prints 3<br>
				# prints out 1,2,3<br>
				for x in mylist:<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(x)
			</code>
			<p>
				<h3>Tuples</h3>
				Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a set or dict instance).
			</p>
			<code>
				a = tuple('abc')<br>print(a)
			</code>
			<p>
				<h3>Ranges</h3>
				The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.
			</p>	
			<code>
				a = list(range(10))<br>
				print(a)
			</code>
			<p>
				Here is Ref <a href='#Reference-Python-Data-Types'>Link</a>

	<section id='If...else_Statements' class='main-section'>
		<header>If...else Statements</header>
		<article>
			<p>
				Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:
			</p>
			<code>
				if x &lt 0:<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;x = 0<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print('Negative changed to zero')<br>
 elif x == 0:<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print('Zero')<br>
 elif x == 1:<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print('Single')<br>
 else:<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print('More')<br>
			</code>
			<p>
				There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.

	<section id='Function_Declaration' class='main-section'>
		<header>Function Declaration</header>
		<article>
			<p>
				The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.</p>

<p>The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or docstring. (More about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation Strings.) There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.</p>

<p>The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global variables, named in a global statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, named in a nonlocal statement), although they may be referenced.</p>

<p>The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object). 1 When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is created for that call.</p>

<p>A function definition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the function name has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-defined function. This value can be assigned to another name which can then also be used as a function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism:
			</p>
			<code>
				def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n<br>
...     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""<br>
...     a, b = 0, 1<br>
...     while a &lt n:<br>
...         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(a, end=' ')<br>
...         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a, b = b, a+b<br>
...     print()<br>	
		fib(2000)
